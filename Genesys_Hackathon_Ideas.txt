1) An AI assistant, Max, that offers a solution to a common problem affecting all customer contact centres - wait times. When all agents are occupied, Max steps in and greets new customers connecting via phone or chat with the solution to their problem whether it be a simple return or something more complex. Max enables customers to receive timely support whilst reducing the traffic to customer contact centres.

Selling Points:
    - Reduces wait times (especially anxiety with having to stay on the phone for long periods of time)
    - Increases overall customer satisfaction

Features:
    - Use keywords to recommend and forward them to specific department
    - Customer side -> call in to make complaint (say issue) - it will parse that and direct it to wherever you need to go
    - PureCloud can be applied to mostly retail businesses (most complaints)
    - Add into an existing system without breaking features

"Max - an AI assistant that helps those who aren't being helped"

MISC:
    
* An app to help pick out key words so that CSR wouldn't have to remember what was said long after the call (using IBM Watson's API)

- Utilize ML (Tensorflow) to better predict what customers may require based on previous contact

2) App to aggregate customer complaints (small businesses only) - Some companies respond slowly on Social Media when they hear complaints and/or don't address them at all => tarnishes their company reputation (helps maintain or establish an improved social media presence)
    - Create an app for PureCloud that aggregates all complaints in one area to equally address them all
    - Person to person point of contact when a customer calls in with a complaint
    - Communicate between customers and businesses so it's not a "one-sided conversation" (Yelp for companies)

Implement on platforms such as:
    -> Computer
    -> Telephone

3) An app that serves like Yelp for companies since companies can't track down and help customers on every website
    -> Companies has profile, customer puts complaint on twitter -> gives a way to reach out to these customers
    -> Customers should be able to complain on whatever platform they're comfortable with

    -> do companies want to show what they did to help solve the problem to others? DM but showing the issue was resolved
