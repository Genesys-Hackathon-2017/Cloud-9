1) An AI assistant, Max, that offers a solution to a common problem affecting all customer contact centres - wait times. When all agents are occupied, Max steps in and greets new customers connecting via phone or chat with the solution to their problem whether it be a simple return or something more complex. Max enables customers to receive timely support whilst reducing the traffic to customer contact centres.

Selling Points:
    - Reduces wait times (especially anxiety with having to stay on the phone for long periods of time)
    - Increases overall customer satisfaction

Features:
    - Use keywords to recommend and forward them to specific department
    - Customer side -> call in to make complaint (say issue) - it will parse that and direct it to wherever you need to go
    - PureCloud can be applied to mostly retail businesses (most complaints)
    - Add into an existing system without breaking features

"Max - an AI assistant that helps those who aren't being helped"

MISC:
    
* An app to help pick out key words so that CSR wouldn't have to remember what was said long after the call (using IBM Watson's API)

- Utilize ML (Tensorflow) to better predict what customers may require based on previous contact

2) App to aggregate customer complaints (small businesses only) - Some companies respond slowly on Social Media when they hear complaints and/or don't address them at all => tarnishes their company reputation (helps maintain or establish an improved social media presence)
    - Create an app for PureCloud that aggregates all complaints in one area to equally address them all
    - Person to person point of contact when a customer calls in with a complaint
    - Communicate between customers and businesses so it's not a "one-sided conversation" (Yelp for companies)
    - Twitter API

    hook up to twitter, write and read priv
    identify bad tweets, 
    use watson as the means of responding to users
    Post to twitter, read tweet and responds in a timely manner

    1. App monitors Twitter for negative tweets about the respective company
    2. Pulls these tweets which are then fed to IBM Watson who replies on Twitter with a follow-up message. IBM Watson also creates a conversation with the CSR to alert them in case they want to personally follow-up

Implement on platforms such as:
    -> Computer
    -> Telephone

3) An app that serves like Yelp for companies since companies can't track down and help customers on every website
    -> Companies has profile, customer puts complaint on twitter -> gives a way to reach out to these customers
    -> Customers should be able to complain on whatever platform they're comfortable with

    -> do companies want to show what they did to help solve the problem to others? DM but showing the issue was resolved

4) Voice to text translation for PureCloud voice calls
    -> Allows users from any different backgrounds and nationalities to speak to PureCloud and have their speech translated into a language known by both parties (ex: French to English)
    -> Reduces the need for multilingual CSR's and region-specific call centres
    -> Decongests call flow (less calls waiting on a specific agent that speaks multiple languages)

    *-> Have to train Watson over-time with previously recorded conversations (increases accuracy and expose to different dialects within the same language)
    *-> What if they're misinterpreted? (Refer to above)

    1. Speech-to-text from IBM Watson
    2. Translate API (IBM Watson)
    3. PureCloud Phone-call API (Start and stop a call)
    4. UI Design - Website
    5. Find conversations that will be translated (ENGLISH -> FRENCH) -> MAMADOUGH?
